    The cascade Algorithm
    1. Position and order of appearance: the order in which your CSS rules appear
    2. Specificity: an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest match 
    3. Origin: the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether that is a browser style, CSS from a browser extension, or your authored CSS 
    4. Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the !important rule type
